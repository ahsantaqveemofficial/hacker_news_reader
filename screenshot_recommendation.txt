## Screenshot Recommendation

To make your README more visually appealing and to give potential users a clear preview of the application, I recommend adding a screenshot to your README.md file.

### How to add a screenshot:

1. Take a high-quality screenshot of your Hacker News Reader application showing:
   - The main interface with stories
   - The favorites panel (if possible)
   - Search functionality in action
   - Dark mode if that's your preferred theme (as it often looks nicer in screenshots)

2. Save the screenshot as `screenshot.png` in the `logo` directory alongside your logo.png file.

3. Add the screenshot to your README.md by inserting this line below the project description:

```markdown
![Hacker News Reader Screenshot](logo/screenshot.png)
```

or replace the current logo display with:

```markdown
<p align="center">
  <img src="logo/logo.png" alt="Hacker News Reader Logo" width="100" />
  <img src="logo/screenshot.png" alt="Hacker News Reader Screenshot" width="800" />
</p>
```

This will make your project more appealing to potential users and contributors, as they can immediately see what your application looks like and how it functions.

Note: When taking the screenshot, try to display interesting content that demonstrates the app's features (search results, favorites, etc.) rather than just the default view.
